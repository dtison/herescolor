HeresColor Postcript CRD Generator for NeXTSTEP
===============================================

Original NeXTSTEP 3.0 application sources.

When you are looking at these sources, you have to keep in mind the time
they were developed in.  I worked on this project from 1992-1993.

I was co-founder of HERE, Inc., a software development startup
on the NeXTSTEP platform in 1992-1993.  HERE was an acronym for
High End Raster Experts.

The company produced color prepress and calibration software on the 
NeXTSTEP OS.  

This code compiles on a NeXTStation Turbo or NeXT Cube running 
NeXTSTEP 3.x.

I put this on github - in part as a tribute to the NeXT and Steve Jobs
and because it is a genuine sample of an original NeXTSTEP application.

A lot of the NeXT API lives on today in OSX / MacOS.

What It Does
============

HeresColor has an interface to get spectrophotomer readings of output, 
(or manual using colors on the display and print)  and generated a
 PostScript CRD (Color Rendering Dictionary) that calibrates color from
 the display ==> print.  
 
Target users were 4 color (and 6 color) production and prepress.
